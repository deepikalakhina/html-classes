        <div class="Paaru" style="background-color: green;">
            <h1>Padding and Margin</h1>
            <p>Space between 2 containers is margin. Space between the content within the container and border of the container.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Paaru">
            <p>Box Model - The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
                It consists of Content, Padding, Border, Margin in the same order mentioned.</p>
                <p>Browser gives priority to apply the CSS in the order - 1st Inline, 2nd Style Tag and then Linked CSS File. 
                    We use Inline when we have to give special style to any element based on requirement / scenario.</p>
                <p>When you want to apply CSS for multiple classes in this case Paaru and Mingi, you need to seperate them using Comma. 
                    If comma is not used, then it become Nested Classes</p>
                    <p>Nested Tag - If we want to give style to specific nested tag ex - body div div p. </p>
                    <p>Display Property - The DIV Block Element takes the width of complete viewport hence the next DIV element takes the next line. 
                        In order to get to DIV block elements side by side we use Display Property. 
                        Now, when used with Inline, the browser tries to get the block in 1 line, it gets the div / any other block element inline 
                        but it cannot get its content because it doesnt consider the width of the inside element.(check google).
                    So, inline block is used to get the two or more block elements side by side. 
                We can also convert inline element to block and vice versa.</p>

        <div class="mingi">

                <p>Nested DIV 1</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Nested DIV 2. Nested DIV 3</p>
            </div>
